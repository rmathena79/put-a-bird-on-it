# Development Notes

PROBLEMS
* None... at the moment

TODO
* Move "normalization" script to a simple .py or maybe the math-ena module, and don't call it "normalization".
* Probably make all table and column names lowercase
* Make ID replacement more efficient by building up one big dictionary of replacement mappings
